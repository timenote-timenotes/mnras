% Abstract of the paper
\begin{abstract}
	Long-period comets C/2019 L3 (ATLAS) and C/2020 P3 (ATLAS) remain active at heliocentric distance more than {\qty{4}{\astronomicalunit}}. Broadband CCD photometry of Long-period comets C/2019 L3 and C/2020 P3 are analyzed in this paper.
	The observation was obtained with three telescopes: ZEISS-1000 at Simeiz Observatory, Maksutov at Abastumani Astrophysical Observatory and ZTSh at Crimean Astrophysical Observatory. The R-band $A(0)f\rho$ values of C/2019 L3 range from {\SI{5043 +- 244}{\cm}} to {\SI{13611 +- 1874}{\cm}}, and tend to decrease first and then increase. The average color indices of C/2019 L3 are $\mathrm{B-V} = \num{0.75 +- 0.06}$, $\mathrm{V-R} = \num{0.27 +- 0.05}$, and $\mathrm{R-I} = \num{0.22 +- 0.05}$. The reddening of C/2019 L3 exhibits variations during the observational runs, from {\SI{13.75 +- 1.07}{\percent/\kilo\angstrom}} to {\SI{-15.69 +- 0.37}{\percent/\kilo\angstrom}} with an average value of {\SI{0.94 +- 0.23}{\percent/\kilo\angstrom}}. It possesses a non-steady coma since the average gradient of its surface brightness profile is \num{-1.66}. For comet C/2020 P3, its R-band $A(0)f\rho$ values range from {\SI{606 +- 31}{\cm}} to {\SI{869 +- 20}{\cm}}, the color indices are $\mathrm{B-V} = \num{0.95 +- 0.07}$, $\mathrm{V-R} = \num{0.29 +- 0.05}$, and $\mathrm{R-I} = \num{0.21 +- 0.05}$, and the reddening is {\SI{-6.65 +- 0.01}{\percent/\kilo\angstrom}}. The color indices of the two comets differ from those of other Long-period comets. Compared with other Long-period comets, comet C/2019 L3 is very active at heliocentric distance of $\thicksim${\qty{4}{\astronomicalunit}}, while C/2020 P3 is moderately active at heliocentric distance of $\thicksim${\qty{7}{\astronomicalunit}}.
