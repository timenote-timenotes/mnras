%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% Basic setup. Most papers should leave these options alone.
\documentclass[fleqn,usenatbib]{mnras}

% MNRAS is set in Times font. If you don't have this installed (most LaTeX
% installations will be fine) or prefer the old Computer Modern fonts, comment
% out the following line
\usepackage{newtxtext,newtxmath}
% Depending on your LaTeX fonts installation, you might get better results with one of these:
% \usepackage{mathptmx}
% \usepackage{txfonts}

% Use vector fonts, so it zooms properly in on-screen viewing software
% Don't change these lines unless you know what you are doing
\usepackage[T1]{fontenc}

% Allow "Thomas van Noord" and "Simon de Laguarde" and alike to be sorted by "N" and "L" etc. in the bibliography.
% Write the name in the bibliography as "\VAN{Noord}{Van}{van} Noord, Thomas"

% Abstract of the paper
\begin{abstract}
	The observational results for two \ul{Long-period} comets, namely C/2019 L3 and C/2020 P3, are analyzed in this paper. 
	Broadband B-, V-, R- and I-images were obtained with three telescopes: ZEISS-1000 at Simeiz Observatory, Maksutov at Abastumani Astrophysical Observatory and ZTSh at Crimean Astrophysical Observatory. 
	The two objects were observed between \DTMdate{2021-3-28} and \DTMdate{2021-5-14} for a total of 13 nights. 
	We study the morphology, photometry, surface brightness, $Af\rho$ values as well as coma colors of the two comets based on these data.

\section*{Data Availability}

 
The inclusion of a Data Availability Statement is a requirement for articles published in MNRAS. Data Availability Statements provide a standardised format for readers to understand the availability of data underlying the research results described in the article. The statement may refer to original data generated in the course of the study or to third-party data analysed in the article. The statement should describe and provide means of access, where possible, by linking to the data or providing the required accession numbers for the relevant databases or DOIs.




%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% REFERENCES %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

% The best way to enter references is to use BibTeX:

\bibliographystyle{mnras}
\bibliography{books} 


% Alternatively you could enter them by hand, like this:
% This method is tedious and prone to error if you have lots of references
