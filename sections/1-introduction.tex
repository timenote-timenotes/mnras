\section{Introduction}

This is a simple template for authors to write new MNRAS papers.
See \texttt{mnras\_sample.tex} for a more complex example, and \texttt{mnras\_guide.tex}
for a full user guide.

All papers should start with an Introduction section, which sets the work
in context, cites relevant earlier studies in the field by \citet{Fournier1901},
and describes the problem the authors aim to solve \citep[e.g.][]{vanDijk1902}.
Multiple citations can be joined in a simple way like \citet{deLaguarde1903, delaGuarde1904}. \SI{10000}{\km}, \DTMdate{2023-06-12}, \DTMdisplaydate{2023}{6}{12}{-1}, \DTMdate{2004-11-7} and \DTMdate{2011-6-30} and \DTMdisplaydate{2023}{6}{12}{-1} \DTMdate{2919-12-last}, \DTMfetchyear{now}, \today
