\section{Discussion and Conclusion}\label{sec:dis}


% From \autoref{tab:afrho} we can conclude that the comet C/2019 L3 is very active due to its high $A(0)f\rho$ values during the observational run, while C/2020 P3 is less active since its $A(0)f\rho$ values are only about {\SI{10}{\percent}} of that of C/2019 L3. 
Comparing $A(0)f\rho$ values with that of other LPCs, just as Fig.~\ref{fig:afrho-ref} shown, C/2019 L3 is very active at heliocentric distance of $\thicksim${\qty{4}{\astronomicalunit}}, and C/2020 P3 is moderately active at heliocentric distance of $\thicksim${\qty{7}{\astronomicalunit}}. 
Moreover, % 在此只写活动性显现出异常, 不作过度猜测
it can be seen from Fig.~\ref{fig:a0frho-c2019} that during the observation period, the R-band $A(0)f\rho$ values of comet C/2019 L3, measured at an aperture of {\SI{e4}{\km}}, showed a trend of initially decreasing followed by an increase. This could be attributed to a previous outburst, followed by a gradual increase in activity as it approaches perihelion. 
On the other hand, 
the BC-band $A(0)f\rho$ value of C/2019 L3 up to \SI{24710 +- 125}{\cm} on \DTMdate{2022-1-19} posted on \st{The} \ul{the} Astronomer's Telegram\footnote{\url{https://www.astronomerstelegram.org/?read=15186}}, with heliocentric distance $r = \SI{3.56}{\astronomicalunit}$ and geocentric distance $\Delta = \SI{2.61}{\astronomicalunit}$, indicates that C/2019 L3 appears very active near the perihelion.

According to the study by \cite{ramirez_ubvric_2012}, the solar colors are as follows: 
${(\mathrm{B} - \mathrm{V})}_{\odot} = \num{0.653 +- 0.005}$, 
${(\mathrm{V} - \mathrm{R})}_{\odot} = \num{0.352 +- 0.007}$, and 
${(\mathrm{R} - \mathrm{I})}_{\odot} = \num{0.350 +- 0.009}$. 
The average color indices of two Long-period comets and three dynamically new comets were calculated by \cite{meech_activity_2009} to be 
$\langle \mathrm{B} - \mathrm{V} \rangle = \num{0.76 +- 0.01}$ and 
$\langle \mathrm{V} - \mathrm{R} \rangle = \num{0.43 +- 0.01}$, 
with their heliocentric distances ranging from \SIrange{5.8}{14.0}{\astronomicalunit}. 
\cite{solontoi_ensemble_2012} studied six Long-period comets within \SI{5}{\astronomicalunit} of the Sun and obtained the average color indices of 
$\langle \mathrm{B} - \mathrm{V} \rangle = \num{0.687 +- 0.005}$ and 
$\langle \mathrm{V} - \mathrm{R} \rangle = \num{0.443 +- 0.003}$. 
\cite{jewittCOLORSYSTEMATICSCOMETS2015} investigated Long-period comets with large range of heliocentric distances (\SIrange{1.875}{17.982}{\astronomicalunit}), and the average color indices were found to be 
$\langle \mathrm{B} - \mathrm{V} \rangle = \num{0.78 +- 0.02}$, 
$\langle \mathrm{V} - \mathrm{R} \rangle = \num{0.47 +- 0.02}$, and 
$\langle \mathrm{R} - \mathrm{I} \rangle = \num{0.42 +- 0.03}$. 


Fig.~\ref{fig:color-color} is the $\langle \mathrm{B}-\mathrm{V} \rangle$ versus $\langle \mathrm{V}-\mathrm{R} \rangle$ plot of C/2019 L3, C/2020 P3 and other LPCs. 
The color index of the Sun \citep{ramirez_ubvric_2012} is marked as a red circle with dot. 
As we can see, the $\langle \mathrm{B} - \mathrm{V} \rangle$ colors of two comets are redder than the Sun, while the $\langle \mathrm{V} - \mathrm{R} \rangle$ colors of them are bluer than the Sun. 
Compared with LPCs in other works, the $\langle \mathrm{B} - \mathrm{V} \rangle$ color of C/2019 L3 is consistent with them, while the $\langle \mathrm{V} - \mathrm{R} \rangle$ color of C/2019 L3 is significantly bluer than them. For C/2020 P3, the $\langle \mathrm{B} - \mathrm{V} \rangle$ color is redder while the $\langle \mathrm{V} - \mathrm{R} \rangle$ color is bluer. 
In general, the color indices of the two LPCs studied in this work differ from those of other LPCs.

In summary, we present the observational results of comets C/2019 L3 and C/2020 P3. The conclusions are as follows: 
\begin{enumerate}
    \item For comet C/2019 L3, A fan-shape structure can be observed in the northeast direction. This feature is visible in both V and R filters. 
    \item The average gradient value  of the surface brightness profile of comet C/2019 L3 is \num{-1.66}, suggesting a nonsteady coma. 
    \item The R-band $A(0)f\rho$ values of C/2019 L3 range from {\qty{5043 +- 244}{\cm}} to {\qty{13611 +- 1874}{\cm}}, and those of C/2020 P3 range from {\qty{606 +- 31}{\cm}} to {\qty{869 +- 20}{\cm}}. Compared to other works, the $A(0)f\rho$ of C/2019 L3 is relatively high at $\thicksim${\qty{4}{\astronomicalunit}}, while that of C/2020 P3 is moderate at $\thicksim${\SI{7}{\astronomicalunit}}. The R-band $A(0)f\rho$ values of C/2019 L3 tend to decrease first and then increase, so it is possible that comet C/2019 L3 experienced an outburst event in the past, and it was still active after this stage. 
    \item The average colors for C/2019 L3 are  
        $\langle \mathrm{B-V} \rangle = \num{0.75 +- 0.06}$, 
        $\langle \mathrm{V-R} \rangle = \num{0.27 +- 0.05}$, and 
        $\langle \mathrm{R-I} \rangle = \num{0.22 +- 0.05}$,  
        while the colors for C/2020 P3 are 
        $\mathrm{B-V} = \num{0.95 +- 0.07}$, 
        $\langle \mathrm{V-R} \rangle = \num{0.29 +- 0.05}$, and 
        $\mathrm{R-I} = \num{0.21 +- 0.05}$. 
        The $\mathrm{B-V}$ colors of C/2019 L3 and C/2020 P3 are redder than the Sun, while the $\mathrm{V-R}$ and $\mathrm{R-I}$ colors of them are bluer than the Sun. Compared to other Long-period comets, both C/2019 L3 and C/2020 P3 exhibit distinct differences in their color indices. The reddening of C/2019 L3 calculated from B-band $Af\rho$ and R-band $Af\rho$ exhibits variations during the observational runs, from {\qty{13.75 +- 1.07}{\percent/\kilo\angstrom}} to {\qty{-15.69 +- 0.37}{\percent/\kilo\angstrom}} with an average value of {\qty{0.94 +- 0.23}{\percent/\kilo\angstrom}}. This could be attributed to  variations in the composition of the coma. As for C/2020 P3, the reddening could only be calculated for the date of \DTMdate{2021-5-12}, yielding a value of {\qty{-6.65 +- 0.01}{\percent/\kilo\angstrom}}. 
\end{enumerate}
